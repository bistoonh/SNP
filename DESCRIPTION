Description: Implements the Stepwise Noise Peeling (SNP) algorithm that bypasses 
	bandwidth selection in Nadaraya-Watson regression by using iterative 
	smoothing. SNP provides a scalable alternative to Direct Generalized 
    Cross-Validation (DGCV) by converting continuous bandwidth optimization 
    into discrete iteration selection, dramatically reducing computational 
    cost while maintaining statistical equivalence.
